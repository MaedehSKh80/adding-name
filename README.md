# 📝 Simple To-Do List

This is a small **To-Do List project** that I originally created about **two years ago** while I was learning the basics of **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

At the time, the project was not fully working. Recently, I decided not to delete it and instead fix and improve it so I can keep track of my progress on GitHub.

## ⭐ Features

- Add items to the list using a button  
- Simple and clean user interface  
- Vanilla JavaScript – no frameworks  
- Beginner-friendly code  
- Fully static project

---

## 🎯 What I Fixed

- The project originally didn't add new list items correctly  
- Event listener and input handling were rewritten  
- Now every click on the button adds the text to the list properly

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- DOM manipulation  
- Handling events in JavaScript  
- Updating and improving older code  
- Version control with Git & GitHub

---

## 🧪 How It Works

1. User types a name in the input box  
2. Clicks the “Add User” button  
3. A new `<li>` item is created and added to the `<ul>` list

## 📌 About This Project

This project is simple, but I’m keeping it in my GitHub as a reminder of how I started and how my skills have grown over time.  
Old code is not something to throw away — it’s something to improve.
